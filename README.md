# Website for CS Research Symposium - Spring 2022
In collaboration with SACM and WACM

Website url: [csresearchsymposium.github.io](https://csresearchsymposium.github.io/)

---

To use a repository for the main website, rename it to:

    csresearchsymposium.github.io

Otherwise, url to the repository, e.g., `NewRepo`, would be:

    csresearchsymposium.github.io/NewRepo

This can be undesired since every relative path in html must have `NewRepo/` prefix.
This prefix is not needed when debugging in local server, so all paths will break.
